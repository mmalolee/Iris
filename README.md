# Iris EDA

An EDA of a classic iris dataset.

## Technologies:
- pandas.

## Key insights:

- The dataset is complete — there are no missing values.
- Virginica flowers are the biggest, especially in petal length and width.
- Setosa has very short and narrow petals, but the widest sepals.
- Petal length, petal width, and sepal length are strongly related — when one increases, the others usually do too.
- Sepal width doesn’t have a strong connection with the other features.
- Setosa has the smallest changes in petal size, while Virginica shows the biggest changes in all sizes.
- The charts clearly show that the three flower types are easy to tell apart based on their measurements.
